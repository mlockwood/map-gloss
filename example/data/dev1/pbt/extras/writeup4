1.  CUSTOMIZATION OF SYSTEM CHOICES


1.1  Matrix Yes-No Questions

Questions in Pashto "are formed by rising intonation at the end of a
sentence." (Babrakzai 1999, p. 64).  No marking or changes in word
order are required.  Focus occurs with stress on the desired
constituent.  Stress on the main verb is applied in long sentences.

Yes-No Questions may also be generated using the tag 'kana', meaning
'if not'.  This tag is placed at the end of a declarative sentence.

Within the Grammar Qustionnaire, the option for a separate question
particle was selected.  The particle is 'ka na', with Sentence Final
marked.




1.2  Coordination

Pashto coordination is primarily accomplished through the use of the
conjuction 'aw' which roughly means the same as 'and' in English.
There are various other coordinating conjunctions but at this stage of
the grammar implementation we are only planning on including 'aw'. If
the implementation of that goes smoothly and we are pleased with the
result the further implementation of other conjunctions is always an
option. Although the meaning of the word 'aw' is like that of English
it is not used in the same way. In Pashto coordination can be
accomplished using either a polysyndeton strategy or a asyndeton
strategy. When the polysyndeton strategy is used the coordination
conjunction appears before the coordinand. All coordinands must
display the case requirements of the position that they are being
coordinated in.


1.2.1 NP Coordination

In NP Coordination, a coordinated NP can occur in any location that a
standard uncoordinated NP can. For the purposes of our grammar that
would be in the s-NP and o-NP positions. NP coordinations use both
polysyndeton strategy or asyndeton strategy. When using either
strategy the Verb must take the plural inflection and agree in PERSON
with the highest PERSON present, 1st > 2nd > 3rd. If all are of the
3rd person and the verb is in the past tense the verb must agree with
the coodinand with the highest gender, M > F, and take the plural
form. With the exception that if the verb agrees in NUMBER, GENDER,
and PERSON with the nearest coordinand in the past tense it can stand
for the whole of the coordination.

The questionnarie implementation of this consisted of the addition of
two coordination strategies. The first specifying polysyndeton marking
by a word 'aw' that comes before the coordinant. As well as a strategy
simply specifying asyndeton coordination on the NP's.

'Me and (the) cat chase (the) dog.'


These previous examples demonstrate the various ways to make a
grammatical NP coordination. 11.01 demonstrates the basic 3rd person
present coordination with the coordinating conjunction 'aw' while
11.05 shows a sentence of the same meaning without the conjunction.
Note in both examples that the verb takes the 3RD.PL morpheme. 11.06
demonstrates the hierarchy of PERSON in verb agreement. While 11.13
and 11.14 demonstrate the subtle differences between an object
position coordination and a subject position coordination when there
are no conjuctions present. The distinction between one and the other
is all in the verb inflection. A few negative examples showing ways in
which these rules are broken follow.

These two examples are ungrammatical because of how they use the
coordinating conjunction.

* cat:F.SG.ABS  and:CONJ  dog:M-SG.ERG   dance:INTR-3RD.PL.PRS
'* (the) cat and (the) dog dances.

Within NP conjunctions all coordinands must agree in the feature CASE.
11.11 is an example of an ungrammatical example where this doesn't
occur.


The following ungrammatical example displays a rule which is not
explicitly stated in any of out sources but I suspect must be the case
to avoid a crippling sort of ambiguity. It can only occur in present
transitive sentences due to the split-ergative nature of Pashto
however.

'* (the) cat and (the) man chase (the) dog and (the) cow.'

This sentence ungrammatical on the basis that there is no
way to tell how many of the nouns present here belong to the subject
and how many belong to the object. I believe this to be a place in the
language where the conjunctions are necessary.

pisho         aw       ser-e          sp-e           aw      kary-e          taqibaw-i
cat:F.SG.ABS  and:CONJ man:M-SG.ABS   dog:M-SG.ABS   and:CONJ  cow:M-SG.ABS    chase:TRAN-3RD.PL.PRES
'(the) cat and (the) man chase (the) dog and (the) cow.'

So 11.19 would then be the grammatical form of that. Or even if only
one, the subject coordination or object coordination, were to display
conjunctions I believe it would eliminate this ambiguity.



1.2.2 Sentence Coordination

Sentence coordination occurs with the use of the conjunction 'aw' and
displays the polysyndeton strategy just as NP coordination but as of
yet we have failed to find examples of its optionality. When
coordinating sentences in Pashto the only thing that needs to be kept
in mind is that the two coordinated sentences need to express the same
tense.

In the questionnaire a strategy for these was specified on sentences
using the polysyndeton strategy using the word 'aw' that comes before
the coordinand.

'*(the) dog dances and I chased (the) cat.'

So 11.20 and 11.21 are grammatical while 11.22 is not.


1.2.3 Verb Coordination

In Pashto the verb coordination is accomplished with the conjunction
'aw' and displays the polysyndeton strategy. The second verb declared
will act on the same set of arguments as the first and will require no
additional markings or case requirements. The only stipulation is that
the tense of both verbs must agree.

In the questionnaire a strategy for these was specified on verbs using
the polysyndeton strategy using the word 'aw' that comes before the
coordinand.

Both of these examples show the correct basic pattern for verb
coordination. An ungrammatical example in which the two verbs do not
agree in tense is as follows.

'*(the) dog dances and chases the cat.'


An interesting thing happens with the split-ergative case marking when
a transitive past and an intrasitive past verb are coordinated. See

Although typically an intransitive verb in the past tense would
require the subject of the sentence to be in the absolutive case. The
presence of a transitive verb in the past tense calls for an ergative
subject. This forces the intransitive verb to accept the ergative case
noun in these constructions. This will be more difficult to implement
in the grammar than any other examples thus far as it will require the
unification of the S-NP requirements on a coordinated VP so that it
will produce three rules. One of which will properly specify that in
these cases intransitive verbs must take an ergative case subject.



1.3  Attributive Adjectives

Adjectives in Pashto appear befor the nouns affected (Shafeev 1964 pp.
23-29).  Inflection occurs based on Gender, Number and Case of the
head noun. Shafeev has identified seven morphological classes of
adjectives.  In general there is nothing morphologically to
distinguish nouns from adjectives, e.g., 'sur' (red:ADJ) vs. 'lur'
(daughter:N), 'mor' (satisfied:ADJ) vs. 'or' (fire:N), and 'praday'
(strange:ADJ) vs. 'saray' (man).

Adjective ungrammaticality appears in two classes:  word order and Gender-Number-Case
agreement with the head noun.

Implementation of adjectives in the grammar is deferred to a later lab.



1.4  Adverbs

Like adjectives, adverbs are not morphologically distinguished from
nouns, adjectives or numbers (Shafeev 1964 pp. 49-50).  Examples of
this similarity are:  'natsapa' (suddenly:ADV) vs. 'naroga' (sick:N),
and 'zer' (quickly:ADV) vs. 'zer' (thousand:N).

Shafeev divides adverbs into five classes, based on use:

     - adverbs of time
     - adverbs of place
     - adverbs of manner (of action)
     - adverbs of measure and degree
     - adverbs of cause and purpose

Generally adverbs are placed before the verb affected.  However,
adverbs of time may be placed before or after the subject, even at the beginning of a sentence.

1.5  Embedded Clauses

1.5.1 Declarative Embedded Clauses

Embedded Clauses in Pashto produce an interesting sort of problem for
this grammar system. In a way the essential SOV word order is not
changed however this is only because of certian placeholder words that
hold those positions. In Pashto the word order for embedded clauses is
SOV(Clause). Where (Clause) can stand for either a clause in the
subject position or one in the object position. Like mentioned above
the S and O positions are not really empty when there is a clause
because there is a word that fills the position. For the subject
position this word is 'dase' = "such" and for the object position this
word is 'da' = "this". These words have no semantic contribution to
the sentence they only exist to refer to the clause at the end of the
sentence.

Any embedded clause in Pashto begins with the particle 'ce' which in
some contexts can mean roughly "that".

A simple example of these phenomenon can be found in 09.02 of our
testsuite.

sp-e          da        anger-i                ce    pisho          nats-e
dog:M-SG.ABS  this      think:TRAN-PRS.3RD.SG  that  cat:F.SG.ABS   dance:INTR-3RD.SG.PAST
'(the) dog thinks [that the cat danced]'

In this example the clause is being refered to by the word 'da' in the
object position of the sentence. The clause that comes after the 'ce'
could otherwise be a stand alone utterance. Because of the argument
optionality principles which have been implemented in our grammar the
following sentence 12.01 is also allowable.

+ dog:M-SG.ABS   think:TRAN-PRS.3RD.SG  that  cat:F.SG.ABS   dance:INTR-3RD.SG.PAST
'+ (the) dog thinks [that the cat danced]'

In this case the placeholder in the object position is missing but it
is still a grammatical sentence. The clause itself however is not
optional.

'+*(the) dog thinks [that the cat danced]'

The distinction between with the placeholders 'da' and 'dase', which
you will see in the next two examples, is quite subtle. It has more to
do with the topic and focus of a sentence and therfore will be
discussed further in section 1.7.

Examples 09.07 and 09.08 show the same phenomenon as in examples 09.01
and 09.09 except that in these cases it is the subject position that
takes the clause. In these examples 'dase' however acts much like the
"dummy-it" construction in English. Observe that although the verb is
transitive it really only takes one complement in these types of
sentences. It is also not correct to place the clause in the typical
position of the role it fills. 09.10 and 09.03 display this.

These are ungrammatical as a clause cannot have a CASE value which
would agree with the verb.

'ce' clause marker.

The clause marker must always preceed the verb.



1.5.1 Interrogative Embedded Clauses

Our sources never actually explicitly cover embedded interogative clauses and further serching has as
of yet turned up little else. However given the information that we have about embedded declaritives and
the usual way Pashto has of handling Martix Yes-No Clauses, I believe it is possible to put forth an educated
guess. The particle 'ce' is used to mark every clause in Pashto and unless the clause is a relative clause its
position will always be post-verbal as demonstrated in the above section. This information with the fact that
almost all cases of Matrix Yes-No questions are handled entirely with inflection leads me to propose the following
as a valid Interogative embedded clause.

# Id: 09.11  Embedded clauses

 I:M-SG.1ST.OBL  this:ABS     ask:TRAN-PAST.3RD.SG  that  cat:F.SG.ABS   dance:INTR-3RD.SG.PAST
'I asked whether (the) cat danced'

As you can see this follows exactly the form of the Pashto Declaritive embedded clause. Only the presence of
the verb 'pukhtedal', "to ask" and if spoken an inflection on the end of the sentence would mark it as an interrogative.
I believe this would account for the lack of information on this exact form of clauses as it is only a type
of declarative clauses using inflection and a certian set of verbs.

Implementation of adjectives in the grammar is deferred to a later lab.



1.6  Non-Verbal Predicates

Noun phrases, adjectives phrases, and adverbial phrases can function
as predicates in Pashto.  These predicates are formed using the verbs
'to be' and 'kedel' (to become).  (NB:  no refernces read have a
Pashto name for the verb 'to be'.  Shafeev states there is no
infinitive for 'to be'.) The copula varies by Gender, Number, Person
and Tense.  No instances of 'copula-drop' have been found in the
literature.

Examples of copula with noun phrases, adjectives and prepositional
phrases are:

Implementation in the grammar consists of instantiating the verbs 'to
be' and 'kedel' (to bedome).




1.7  Information Structure

In Pashto Information Structure is largely marked with syntax. More
specifically the FOCUS of a sentence is found immediately preceeding
the verb while the TOPIC is found at the head of the sentence. So in a
typical transitive sentence like 17.01. It would be assumed that
'pisho' is the TOPIC while 'spe' is the FOCUS.

cat:F.SG.ABS(Topic)  dog:M-SG.ABS(Focus)  chase:TR-3SG.PRS
'Cat chases dog.'



A number of changes in the syntax of the sentence occur specifically
to facilitate this contrast. One already discussed a little is the
inclusion and exclusion of placeholders in embedded clauses.

'(the) dog(topic) thinks [that the cat danced](focus)'


The existance of da in the immediate pre-verb position in 17.04 refers
the FOCUS of the sentence to the clause following the verb.

In most negative sentences the sentential negation marker 'na' will
take the FOCUS as in example 17.05.

'He(TOPIC) doesn't(FOCUS) write.'


The change is information structure can be seen most clearly with the
shift in FOCUS when using adverbs as in examples 17.06 and 17.07.

+ dog:M-3PL.ERG  cat:F.3PL.ABS yesterday:ADV   chase:INTR-3SG.PST
'+ (The) dogs(TOPIC) chased (the) cats yesterday(FOCUS).'

When 'pisho' is in the preverbal position and 'parun' proceeds
'pisho', 'pisho' becomes the FOCUS for the sentence. However when the
order of these two words is reversed 'parun' then becomes the FOCUS.


Like in FOCUS there are a number of examples that can be used to demonstrate how word order
changes the assignment of TOPIC in a sentence. Take for example 17.08 and 17.09 and below.

I believe that when the determiner is present as in sentence 17.08 the TOPIC is directed onto the
subject that it refers to as in [Cat] in that example. But when it is absent and the adjective takes
the front position in the sentence 'pradey' "strange" in example 17.09 takes the TOPIC. Meaning that
the established discourse concerned a cat who was strange while in 17.08 the established discourse
only concerned a cat.

Major changes to the lexicon were addition of the verb 'to be'.  This
verb is irregular in Pashto.

Minor changes to the grammar and lexicon (apart from work described
ealier) include:

    - dropping duplicate lexical entries for 'yaw' (one) and 'har'
      (each).  These were implemented in Lab2 for early test sentences,
      and reimplemented as part of Demonstratives/Definiteness. The
      duplicate entries were causing overgeneration.

    - removed "plural" forms of 'da', 'daga' and 'haga' (this, this,
      that).




2.  UNADDRESSED LANGUAGE PROPERTIES IN THE TEST SUITE


2.1  Coordination of Intransitive and Transitive Sentences

With Pashto, the presence of a transitive verb in the past tense
requires an ergative subject while the presence of  an intransitive
verb requires an absolutive case subject. However the transitive seems
to be dominant in these constructions and the intransitive takes an
ergative as a subject.

Per discussions with Dr. Bender, this can only be resolved by manually
updating TDL files.


2.2  The Rest

Other items currently in the test suite but not in the grammar are
listed below.  It is anticipated all of these phenomena will be
implemented in later labs.


  - conjunctions for embedded clauses, e.g., 'ce' (that)

  - 'ka na', the Pashto question tag.  'ka na' cannot be implemented
    using the Questionnaire due to a space in the word form.

3.  GRAMMAR COVERAGE


Summary:

    242 Sentences
    150 Positive Items with coverage of 49%
     92 Negative Items with coverage of 24%

Problems contributing to parsing errors are:

    1.  Coordination:  overgeneration in coordination.  Pashto has
        specific rules for coordination which cannot be represented
        using the Questionnaire.  For example, if the verb is taking a
        oordinated noun phrase as the subject, it must take the plural
        form of the verb.  This problem exists in almost every test
        sentence involving coordination.

# Id: 11.12  NP coordination with markers

I:1ST.SG.ABS   cat:F.SG.ABS  and:CONJ  dog:M-SG.ABS   chase:TRAN-1ST.SG.PRS
'I chase (the) cat and (the) dog.'


        Also, the coordinating conjunction 'aw' (and) is optional
        in Pashto.  As such, the grammar has difficulty distinguishing
        between two separate nouns with a transitive verb, and
        two nouns with a dropped conjunction and a dropped argument.

I:1SG.ABS  dog:M-SG.ABS  chase:TR-PRS.1SG
'I chase (the) dog.'

        The original interpretation of this sentence is 'I chase (the)
        dog.'  With argument optionality and conjuction optionality,
        this sentence may be read as 'I and (the) dog chase.' where
        the object after chase is dropped.

        Put another way, argument optionality coupled with conjunction
        optionality and no restrictions with verb inflection on
        coordinated noun phrase cause most of the ambiguity (and
        overgeneration) we see in the test suite.


    2.  'ka na', the Pashto question tag:  have not (yet) implemented
         the suggest workaround of:

              ka%20na := qpart-lex-item &
                [ STEM < "ka na" > ].

              to this:

              ka-na := qpart-lex-item &
                [ STEM < "ka", "na" > ].


    3.  Conjugation of the verb 'to be':  the grammar rules were
        developed with one tranliteration but the test suite sentences
        were developed with another. Some parses did occur, but not all of
        the parses for the past and future tense of 'to be'.  This will be
        corrected very soon.  Here are verb stems from the current choices
        file:

            verb3_stem1_orth=yem
            verb3_stem1_pred=_is_v_rel
            verb4_stem1_orth=yu

            verb17_stem1_orth=we
            verb17_stem1_pred=_is_v_rel

        Sentences from Shafeev 1965 use a 'v*' transliteration rather than a
        'w*'.

    4.  Adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions:  all of the adjectives, adverbs and the
        conjunction 'ce' (that) have no been implemented in the lexicon.  This is
        a known issue.

While this analysis is not exhaustive, we are confident these cases
classify 90% of the problems found in the current grammar.




4.  LANGUAGE FEATURES NOT SUPPORTED


4.1  Verb coordination conflict

As mentioned in section 2.1, the customization system cannot handle
the case where two sentences, one with an intransitive verb, past
tense, and the other a transitive verb, past tense, are joined using
the coordinator 'aw' (and).

4.2  'ka na' tag for questions

The particle 'ka na' (if not) cannot be used with Matrix Yes-No
Questions in the customization system.  A space in the word form is
causing the problem.




5.  PROBLEMS IN LAB WORK


5.1  Handling of irregular verbs

The Questionnaire seems ill-suited to handle inflections of irregular
verbs. Our solution involved declaring a number of verb classes one
for each inflection at the worst case. The solution however messy was
usable though.
